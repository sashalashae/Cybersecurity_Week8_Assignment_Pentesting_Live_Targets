# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

> Objective: The challenge is to attempt to find and exploit the vulnerabilities. The goal is to identify which two vulnerabilities of each site: red, green, and blue.

The following **required** functionality is completed:

1. [X]  Required: Challenge 0 - Username Enumeration
1. [X]  Required: Challenge 1 - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
1. [X]  Required: Challenge 2 - SQL Injection (SQLi)
1. [X]  Required: Challenge 3 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
1. [X]  Required: Challenge 4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
1. [X]  Required: Challenge 5 - Session Hijacking/Fixation


## Challenge 0: Username Enumeration
- Vulnerability Site: Green
- Vulberability: If you enter in the name of a known user like jmonroe99 and a random password,  you will recieve an error message.  The error message is bold, but if you enter in a random username like hokie1 and a password it is not bold.  The programmer indicates found users by making their unsuccessful logins bold, which can be exploit.

Here's a walkthrough of implemented vulnerability:
